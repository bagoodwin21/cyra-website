    question: "What if I've already had labs done recently?",
    answer:
      "Bring them — recent labs are genuinely useful. If they're comprehensive and current (generally within the last few months), Dr. Mondona may not need to reorder everything; she'll review what you have and order only what's missing for a complete hormonal and metabolic picture.",

    question: "Do I need a referral?",

      "No. CYRA is a direct, cash-pay practice — you can book your discovery call today without a referral, insurance authorization, or any paperwork from another provider.",

    question: "What states do you serve?",

      "CYRA currently serves patients located in California. All visits are conducted by secure video telehealth, so anywhere in the state works — from your home, office, or parked car between school pickups.",

    question: "Can I use HSA/FSA funds?",
    answer:
      "In most cases, yes. CYRA's medical services are generally eligible expenses for HSA and FSA accounts, and we can provide documentation for your administrator. We also provide superbills on request for potential out-of-network insurance reimbursement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the care plan isn't working for me?",
    answer:
      "Your protocol isn't set in stone — adjusting it as your body responds is the whole point of ongoing physician care. If something isn't working, message through the portal or raise it at your follow-up, and Dr. Mondona will reassess and revise the approach. If a concern ever goes beyond the protocol itself, talk to us directly — we'd rather solve it with you than have you quietly unhappy.",
